    "With supervised learning - regression and classification - we aim to learn the pattern between a set of fixed size input and ouptput data points.  For example, with object detection (a classification problem) we can use a classification algorithm to learn a model that distinguishes between image patches containing an object of interest (e.g., human face) and all those *not* containing this object.  This classification problem is shown figuratively in the image below (used with permission from [[1]](#bib_cell).\n",

    "\n",
    "Note one key aspect of this sort of problem we can solve with supervised learning: *the dimension of the inputs / outputs must always be the same length.*  With object detection the inputs - image patches - are all the same size e.g., a 64 x 64 grid of pixels and the outputs - labels - are integer valued scalars.  An example of a small image patch showing the value of each pixel (taken from [[2]](#bib_cell)) is shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "But not all pattern recognition problems satisfy this condition.  For example a program that translates sentences from English to Spanish (or from any one language to another language) does not (this task is callled *Machine Translation*).  For example, say we wanted to train a model to automatically translate English to Spanish Sentences using the following set of two sentences\n",

    "\n",
    "Measuring some basic statistics for these input / output datapoints we can see that their dimensions are not consistent.\n",

    "- **first sentence:** english input - 7 words, 31 characters, spanish output - 7 words 32 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **second sentence:** english input - 6 words, 29 characters, spanish output - 7 words, 40 characters\n",
    "\n",

    "Because of these inconsistencies, if we want to learn a relationship from data (many many English / Spanish sentence pairs) we need a more flexible machine learning model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).  RNNs offer a more flexible input / output pattern recognition system for solving just this sort of problem."
